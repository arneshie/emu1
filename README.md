# A simple CHIP-8 emulator

Writing this application as a learning process to understand emulation better.
Written entirely in C, using openGL2 for the user interface.

**TODO**: 

* Handle user input
* Finish implementing remaining OPcodes, only ~12/35 are implemented thus far.
* Setup adequate test cases & scripts to automate testing
* Cleanup the openGL code / UI code 
* Convert to CMAKE project and reorganize code
* Commenting to explain each OP code / documentation
* Handling variable framerate / clockspeed to play at 15 fps.

Feel free to fork and contribute to any of the todo tasks!
